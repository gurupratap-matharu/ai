# Gender classification challenge using Random Forest Technique

## Overview
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a random forest algorithm on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

## Dependencies
Install missing dependencies using pip

Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) numpy (pip install numpy) scipy (pip install scipy)

## Usage
Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

python randomforest.py
